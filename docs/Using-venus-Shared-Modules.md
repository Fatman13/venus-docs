## Background

Starting filecoin mining could be a daunting task given not only the large initial hardware and filecoin collateral [investment](https://filscan.io/calculator) but also the entailing operation commitment. With ideas of security, ease of use and distributed mining pool in mind, Venus implementation of filecoin will help miners turn, what community say, [a full time job](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/CEGN061C5/p1610810730117900?thread_ts=1610809298.116800&cid=CEGN061C5) into a serious hobby. Hope this tutorial will get you started mining in no time! 

## How mining works

There are two ways of getting started with mining using Venus. 

1. Deploy minimum hardware and gain access to a publicly hosted shared venus modules. <!--(Checkout venus incubation center page to learn more on how you can get an account setup!)-->
2. Deploy all required hardware and venus modules by yourself.

After following the rest of the trutorial and successful deployment, you can start pledging sectors, grow power and evantually obtain block rewards through your contribution to the network's storage capacity!

## Introducing venus modules

Depending on its role in a mining cluster, modules could be loosely broken down into two category: shared and independent. Shared modules could be thought as the plumbings of what you need to start sealing sectors. Most of the dealings with the blockchain like chain synchronizations, sending messages, winning a block and etc are handled by the shared modules. The idea is that many miners could all use a set of shared modules, thus reducing overhead in maintainence. Independent modules handles sealing and proving of your sectors, where you will be spend most of your time if you choose to use a publicly hosted shared venus modules. Note also that venus-wallet module could be deployed as either shared or independent.

## Hardware requirements

Learn more about hardware requirements [here](https://docs.filecoin.io/mine/mining-architectures/#protocol-labs-example-architecture).

## Pre-requisites

Before diving into deployment of your mining operation, please make sure you go through the following steps. 

:::tip 

It is recommended that you test your setup in nerpa or calibration network before deploying on mainnet. 

:::

### Setup your permanent storage

Choose a network file system that you are familiar with (NFS for example) and deploy your storage cluster.

### Get your account setup in shared modules

There are two ways to have your account setup.

#### For miners connecting to shared modules

If you are trying to connect to a hosted shared venus modules, <!--like ones provided by venus incubation center,--> contact admin of said service and have them set it up for you.

#### For admins of shared modules

If you are an admin hosting shared venus modules, use the following command to create an account for your miner.

```bash
# If miner doesn't have <MINER_ID> yet, leave out --miner flag
$ ./venus-auth addUser --name <ACCOUNT_NAME> --miner <MINER_ID>
# The returned token is what miner have to add into their config file in order to gain access to your shared modules
$ ./venus-auth genToken --perm write <ACCOUNT_NAME>
<AUTH_TOKEN_FOR_ACCOUNT_NAME>
```

### Software dependencies

You will need the following software installed before running venus.

#### Build tools

Ubuntu/Debian:

```shell
sudo apt install mesa-opencl-icd ocl-icd-opencl-dev gcc git bzr jq pkg-config curl clang build-essential hwloc libhwloc-dev wget -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

CentOS:

```bash
sudo yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm; sudo yum install -y git gcc bzr jq pkgconfig clang llvm mesa-libGL-devel opencl-headers ocl-icd ocl-icd-devel hwloc-devel
```

#### Go

To build venus, you need a working installation of [Go 1.16 or higher](https://golang.org/dl/).

```bash
wget -c https://golang.org/dl/go1.16.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz -O - | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local
```

Add `/usr/local/go/bin` to your path and setup `Go` env. For most Linux distributions you can run something like:

```bash
echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
# setup go env
go env -w GOPROXY=https://goproxy.io,direct
go env -w GO111MODULE=on
```

See the [official Golang installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) if you get stuck.

## Install venus-wallet

Download and compile the source code of venus-wallet.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus-wallet.git
# change directory to venus-wallet
$ cd venus-wallet 
# ?network
$ make
```

Run venus-wallet module in background.

```bash
$ nohup ./venus-wallet run > wallet.log 2>&1 &
```

:::tip 

Use `tail -f wallet.log` to monitor wallet log.

:::

Setup a password for your venus-wallet.

```bash
$ ./venus-wallet setpwd
Password:******
Enter Password again:******
Password set successfully
```

Generate owner and worker addresses. (If you don't have an existing miner id)

```bash
$ ./venus-wallet new bls
<OWNER_ADDRESS>
$ ./venus-wallet new bls
<WORKER_ADDRESS>
```

:::tip

If you are testing on Nerpa or Calibration, you have to fund all your addresses with test coins from faucets. For nerpa, use this [faucet](https://faucet.nerpa.interplanetary.dev/funds.html). For calibration, use this [faucet](https://faucet.calibration.fildev.network/funds.html). 

:::

Change `[APIRegisterHub]` section of of the config file using the credential you get from shared module admin.

```toml
[APIRegisterHub]
RegisterAPI = ["/ip4/<IP_ADDRESS_OF_VENUS_WALLET>/tcp/45132"]
Token = "<AUTH_TOKEN_FOR_ACCOUNT_NAME>"
SupportAccounts = ["<ACCOUNT_NAME>"]
```

Restart venus-wallet so that the changes takes into effect.

```bash
# grep [PID] of venus-wallet process
$ ps -ef | grep wallet
# kill the process and restart
$ kill [PID]
$ nohup ./venus-wallet run > wallet.log 2>&1 &
```

:::tip

Using process controll like  `systemmd` or `supervisord` is recommended.

:::

## Install venus-sealer

Download and compile the source code of venus-sealer.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus-sealer.git
$ cd venus-sealer
# make dependency
$ make deps
$ make
```

### Initialize sealer with a new miner id

If you don't have a miner id yet, run the following command to initialize sealer.

```bash
$ nohup ./venus-sealer init \
--worker <WORKER_ADDRESS> \
--owner <OWNER_ADDRESS>  \
# Choose between 32G or 64G for mainnet
--sector-size 512M \
# Choose from nerpa, calibration. Leave out --network for mainet?
--network nerpa \
# Config for different shared venus modules
--node-url /ip4/<IP_ADDRESS_OF_VENUS>/tcp/3453 \
--messager-url /ip4/<IP_ADDRESS_OF_VENUS_MESSAGER>/tcp/3453 \

# Flags sealer to not storing any sealed sectors on the machine it runs on
--no-local-storage \
--wallet-name ? \
> sealer.log 2>&1 &

```

## Start pledging

Run sealer.

```bash
$ nohup ./venus-sealer run >> sealer.log 2>&1 &
```

:::tip 

If you are running sealer for the 1st time, it will start to download proof parameters, which may take quite some time. If you are located in China, follow the tips [here](https://venus.filecoin.io/Tips-Running-In-China.html) to speed up the process.  

:::

Attach permanent storage to sealer.

```bash
$ ./venus-sealer storage attach --init --store --seal <ABSOLUTE_PATH_OF_YOUR_NETWORK_STORAGE>
```

Pledge a single sector.

```bash
$ ./venus-sealer sectors pledge 
```

Check ongoing sealing job.

```bash
$ ./venus-sealer sealing
```
